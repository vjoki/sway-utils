Tools to make my life in [Sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway) more bearable.

- `sway-focus-switcheroo`: Switch to the previously focused window.
- `sway-window-nav`: Cycle focus, or move focused window, forwards/backwards
  through _all_ windows in the currently focused workspace in a hopefully
  deterministic order.
- `swaybar-proc-graph`: Print out CPU or memory usage graph using braille
  symbols, compatible with the [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar)
  custom module.
- `locale1-xkb-config-rs`: Source Sway keyboard config from the
   [systemd-localed D-Bus
   interface](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/org.freedesktop.locale1.html).
   Port of the Python implementation from
   [sway-systemd](https://github.com/alebastr/sway-systemd).

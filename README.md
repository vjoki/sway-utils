# sway-utils
Tools to make my life in [sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway) more bearable.

- `sway-focus-switcheroo`: Switch to the previously focused window.
- `sway-window-nav`: Cycle focus, or move focused window, forwards/backwards
  through _all_ windows in the currently focused workspace in a hopefully
  deterministic order.
- `swaybar-proc-graph`: Print out CPU or memory usage graph using braille
  symbols, compatible with the [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar)
  custom module.
